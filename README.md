# Python for penetration testing
In this course, you'll learn about sockets, create a TCP server and client, build an Nmap scanner, and other tools and techniques that pen testers use daily.

## Tools
- TCP server ([sockets/server.py](https://github.com/hernanchamorro-rt/is-python-pentesting/blob/main/sockets/server.py))
- TCP client ([sockets/client.py](https://github.com/hernanchamorro-rt/is-python-pentesting/blob/main/sockets/client.py))

## Code
```
python3 sockets/server.py

Response:
Connection from ('192.168.2.2', 57380) has been established!
Received message: Hello from the client!


python3 sockets/client.py

Response:
Received message: Welcome to the TCP server!
```
